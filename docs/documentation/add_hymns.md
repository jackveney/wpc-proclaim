## 1. Import Item
 Add a new hymn by doing the following:

## 2. Find Hymn in GTG Folder
 Find the hymn in the GTG folder that you want to import. The layout of the GTG folder is the following:
 
   ```
   GTG:
    --> Hymns for Projection:
      --> Hymns by Number:
         --> Harmony PDF
         --> Harmony PPT
         --> Lyrics Only PDF
         --> Lyrics Only PPT
         --> Melody PDF
         --> Melody PPT
    --> Instructions and Permissions:
      --> Copyright Information
   ```
 
 
 You want to select the Melody PPT to import into Proclaim.
 
 <i>I will use the Opening Hymn #749 from 11/13/2022 as the example on this page.</i>

## 3. Import
 After you find the correct hymn, make sure that it will convert the powerpoint to images, and that the box for use only on this computer is not checked.
